This is the first post in my new blog
where I want to write about things related to my research at WSU
and things that just interest me or I find them exiciting.
So, mainly, it would be about computational topology,
and a little bit about statisitcs and machine learning.

Also, I see this blog as means to improve my writing skills and make a habit of writing,
or at least to stress less about it.
