Currently, I am a PhD student at the Department of Mathematics and statisitcs at Washington State University.
My advisor is [Bala Krishnamoorthy](http://www.math.wsu.edu/math/faculty/bkrishna).
My primary research interests are in computation topology and machine learning, and their interaction.

### A book quote
<!-- "Alice's Adventures in Wonderland" and "Through the Looking-Glass" by Lewis Carroll
are my most favorite books.
I grow up with these stories, they left a deep impression on my,
and I am still enjoying them. -->



> ‘I daresay you haven’t had much practice,’ said the Queen. ‘When I was your age, I always did it for half-an-hour a day. Why, sometimes I’ve believed as many as six impossible things before breakfast.‘[^footnote]
