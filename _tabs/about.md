Currently, I am a PhD student at the [Department of Mathematics and Statisitcs](https://www.math.wsu.edu/) of [Washington State University](https://www.wsu.edu/).
My advisor is [Bala Krishnamoorthy](http://www.math.wsu.edu/math/faculty/bkrishna).
My research interests are in computation topology and optimization, machine learning, and their intersection -- Topological Data Analysis (TDA).

My PhD research is focused on finding more efficient algorithms for some problems of optimal homology, for example for Multiscale Simplicial Flat Norm. My main results are 
* a network flow model for computing **optimal homologous $d$-cycle** in $(d + 1)$-simplicial complexes embedded in $\mathbb{R}^{d +1}$[^footnote];
* a network flow model for computing **optimal scaled Flat Norm decomposition of a $d$-cycle** in $(d + 1)$-simplicial complexes embedded in $\mathbb{R}^{d +1}$[^footnote];
* proven stability of flat norm distance for simple piece-wise linear 1-currents in $\mathbb{R}^{d +1}$[^fn-nth-2]]; 
* introduced **normalized flat norm** for purposes of reliable and stable comparison of complicated network-like geometries[^fn-nth-2].
